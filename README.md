This week, a boring topic, [monotonicity post](./2023-11-09_Monotonicity/README.md) with a prometheus/graphite-statsd/victoriametrics/mimir and opentelemetry collector agent demo with docker compose to make it fun and to introduce monotonicity which is an important topic on OTLP metrics but also graphite/statsd, prometheus, victoriametrics, mimir, ...

In the meantime of writing this post, the Grafana team did a good job at writing a post about cumulative vs delta models (with DataDog and other tools): [OpenTelemetry metrics: A guide to Delta vs. Cumulative temporality trade-offs](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/)

The demo covers this [monotonicity post](./2023-11-09_Monotonicity/README.md) and [the grafana lab post](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/)
